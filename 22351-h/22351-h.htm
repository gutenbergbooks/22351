HARPER’S LIBRARY OF SELECT NOVELS.</a></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>“<span class = "smallcaps">The Library of Select Novels</span>” has
become an institution, a reliable and unfailing recreative resource
essential to the comfort of countless readers. The most available
entertainment of modern times is fiction: from the cares of busy life,
from the monotonous routine of a special vocation, in the intervals of
business and in hours of depression, a good story, with faithful
descriptions of nature, with true pictures of life, with authentic
characterization, lifts the mind out of the domain of care, refreshes
the feelings, and enlists the imagination. The Harpers’ “Library of
Select Novels” is rapidly approaching its four hundredth number, and it
is safe to say that no series of books exists which combines
attractiveness and economy, local pictures and beguiling narrative, to
such an extent and in so convenient a shape. In railway-cars and
steamships, in boudoirs and studios, libraries and chimney corners, on
verandas and in private sanctums, the familiar brown covers are to be
seen. These books are enjoyed by all classes; they appear of an average
merit, and with a constant succession that is marvelous; and in subject
and style offer a remarkable variety.&mdash;<i>Boston

<p>This volume brings the life of Jefferson in a brief space within the
reach of all. While not writing of him as of the great man or statesman,
Miss Randolph has given sufficient outline of the contemporary public
events, especially of those in which Jefferson was engaged, to make the
history of his times sufficiently clear. Her object, however, she says,
has been to give a faithful picture of Jefferson as he was in private
life, and for this she was particularly well fitted. Her biography is so
artless, so frank, and so uncolored, differing so completely from the
lives of public men as generally written. * * * This extremely
interesting volume.&mdash;<i>Richmond Whig.</i></p>

<p>One of the most charming and entertaining of books, and its pages
will be a source of continual surprise and pleasure to those who, while
admiring the statesman, have had their admiration tempered by the belief
that he was a demagogue, a libertine, a gamester, and a scoffer at
religion. The age in which Jefferson lived was one in which political
rancors and animosities existed with no less bitterness than in our
later day, and in which, moreover, mutual abuse and malignant
recrimination were indulged in with equal fury and recklessness. Charges
were made against Jefferson, by his political opponents, that clung to
his good name and sullied it, making it almost a by-word of shame, and
its owner a man whose example was to be shunned. The prejudices and
calumnies then born have existed down to the present day; but the mists
of evil report that have hemmed his life and his memory about are now
clearing away, and this sunny book will dispel the last shadow they have
cast, and will display the maligned victim of party hate in his true
character&mdash;as a fond, an amiable, and a simple-hearted father; a
firm friend; a truly moral and God-fearing citizen, and one of those few
great men who have had the rare fortune to be likewise good
men.&mdash;<i>Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

<p>The author of this charming book has had access to the best possible
sources of information concerning the private character of
Mr.&nbsp;Jefferson, embracing both the written testimony of his
correspondence and the oral testimony of family tradition. From these
materials, guided by a profound reverence for the subject, the writer
has constructed a most interesting personal biography. * * * A&nbsp;most
agreeable addition to American literature, and will revive the memory of
a patriot who merits the respect and gratitude of his
countrymen.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Age.</i></p>

<p>This handsome volume is a valuable acquisition to American history.
It brings to the public observation many most interesting incidents in
the life of the third President; and the times and men of the republic’s
beginnings are here portrayed in a glowing and genial light. The author,
in referring to the death-scenes of Jefferson, reports sentiments from
his lips which contradict the current opinion that the writer of the
Declaration of Independence was an infidel. We are glad to make this
record in behalf of truth. Young people would find this book both
entertaining and instructive. Its style is fresh and compact. Its pages
are full of tender memories. The great man whose career is so charmingly
pictured belongs to us all.&mdash;<i>Methodist Recorder.</i></p>

<p>There is no more said of public matters in it than is absolutely
necessary to make it clear and intelligible; but we have Jefferson, the
man and the citizen, the husband, the father, the agriculturist, and the
neighbor&mdash;the man, in short, as he lived in the eyes of his
relatives, his closest friends, and his most intimate associates. He is
the Virginian gentleman at the various stages of his marvelous career,
and comes home to us as a being of flesh and blood, and so his story
gives a series of lively pictures of a manner of existence that has
passed away, or that is so passing, for they are more conservative at
the South, socially speaking, than are we at the North, though they live
so much nearer the sun than we ever can live. * * * We can commend this
book to every one who would know the main facts of Mr.&nbsp;Jefferson’s
public career, and those of his private life. It is the best work
respecting him that has been published, and it is not so large as to
repel even indolent or careless readers. It is, too, an ornamental
volume, being not only beautifully printed and bound, but well
illustrated. * * * Every American should own the volume.&mdash;<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>

<p>A charmingly compiled and written book, and it has to do with one of
the very greatest men of our national history. There is scarcely one on
the roll of our public men who was possessed of more progressive
individuality, or whose character will better repay study, than Thomas
Jefferson, and this biography is a great boon.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y.
Evening Mail.</i></p>

<p>Both deeply interesting and valuable. The author has displayed great
tact and taste in the selection of her materials and its
arrangement.&mdash;<i>Richmond Dispatch.</i></p>

<p>A charming book.&mdash;<i>New Orleans Times.</i></p>

<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<p>It is a series of delightful home pictures, which present the hero as
he was familiarly known to his family and his best friends, in his
fields, in his library, at his table, and on the broad verandah at
Monticello, where all the sweetest flavors of his social nature were
diffused. His descendant does not conceal the fact that she is proud of
her great progenitor; but she is ingenious, and leaves his private
letters mostly to speak for themselves. It has been thought that “a king
is never a hero to his valet,” and the proverb has been considered
undeniable; but this volume shows that Jefferson, if not exactly the
“hero” to whom a little obscurity is so essential, was at least warmly
loved and enthusiastically esteemed and admired by those who knew him
best. The letters in this volume are full of interest, for they are
chiefly published for the first time now. They show a conscientious
gentleman, not at all given to personal indulgences, quick in both anger
and forgiveness, the greatest American student of his time, excepting
the cold-blooded Hamilton, absolutely without formality, but particular
and exacting in the extreme&mdash;just the man who carried his wife to
the White House on the pillion of his gray mare, and showed a British
embassador the door for an offense against
good-breeding.&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>The reader will recognize the calm and philosophic yet earnest spirit
of the thinker, with the tenderness and playful amiability of the father
and friend. The letters can not but shed a favorable light on the
character of perhaps the best-abused man of his
time.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>No attempt is made in this volume to present its subject as a public
man or as a statesman. It is simply sought to picture him as living in
the midst of his domestic circle. And this it is which will invest the
book with interest for all classes of readers, for all who, whatever
their politics, can appreciate the beauty of a pure, loving life. * * *
It is written in an easy, agreeable style, by a most loving hand, and,
perhaps, better than any other biography extant, makes the reader
acquainted with the real character of a man whose public career has
furnished material for so much book-making.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>The perusal of this interesting volume confirms the impression that
whatever criticisms may be brought to bear upon the official career of
Mr.&nbsp;Jefferson, or his influence upon the politics of this country,
there was a peculiar charm in all the relations of his personal and
social life. In spite of the strength of his convictions, which he
certainly often expressed with an energy amounting to vehemence, he was
a man of rare sunniness of temperament and sweetness of disposition. He
had qualities which called forth the love of his friends no less than
the hatred of his opponents. His most familiar acquaintance cherished
the most ardent admiration of his character. His virtues in the circle
of home won the applause even of his public
adversaries.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>It lifts up the curtain of his private life, and by numerous letters
to his family allows us to catch a glimpse of his real nature and
character. Many interesting reminiscences have been collected by the
author and are presented to the reader.&mdash;<i>Boston Commercial
Bulletin.</i></p>

<p>These letters show him to have been a loving husband, a tender
father, and a hospitable gentleman.&mdash;<i>Presbyterian.</i></p>

<p>Jefferson was not only eloquent in state papers, but he was full of
point and clearness amounting to wit in his minor
correspondence.&mdash;<i>Albany Argus.</i></p>

<p>It is the record of the life of one of the most extraordinary men of
any age or country.&mdash;<i>Richmond Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>With the public life of Thomas Jefferson the public is familiar, as
without it no adequate knowledge is possible of the history of Virginia
or of the United States. Its guiding principles and great events, as
likewise its smallest details, have long been before the world in the
“Jefferson Papers,” and in the laborious history of Randall. But to a
full appreciation of the politician, the statesman, the publicist, and
the thinker, there was still wanting some complete and correct knowledge
of the man and his daily life amidst his family. This want Miss Randolph
has endeavored most successfully to supply. As scarcely one of the
founders of the republic had warmer friends, or exerted a deeper and a
wider influence upon the country, so scarcely one encountered more
bitter animosity or had to live down slander more envenomed. Truth
conquered in the end, and the foul rumors, engendered in partisan
conflicts, against the private life of Jefferson have long shrunk into
silence in the light of his fame. Nevertheless, it is well done of his
descendant thus to place before the world his life as in his letters and
his conversation it appeared from day to day to those nearest and
dearest to him. Nor is it a matter of small value to bring to our sight
the interior life of our ancestors as it is delineated in the letters of
Jefferson, touching incidently on all the subjects of dress, food,
manners, amusements, expenditures, occupations&mdash;in brief,
neglecting nothing of what the men of those days were and thought and
did. It is of such materials that consist the pictures of history whose
gaunt outlines of battles, sieges, coronations, dethronements, and
parliaments are of little worth without the living and breathing details
of everyday existence. * * * The author has happily performed her task,
never obtruding her own presence upon the reader, careful only to come
forward when necessary to explain some doubtful point or to connect the
events of different dates. She may be congratulated upon the grace with
which she has both written and forborne to write, never being beguiled
by the vanity of authorship or that too great care which is the
besetting sin of biography.&mdash;<i>Petersburg Daily Index.</i></p>

<p>It is a highly interesting book, not only as a portraiture of the
domestic life of Jefferson, but as a side view of the parties and
politics of the day, witnessed in our country seventy years ago. The
correspondence of the public characters at that period will be read with
special interest by those who study the early history of our
government.&mdash;<i>Richmond Christian Observer.</i></p>

<p>In the unrestrained confidence of family correspondence, nature has
always full sway, and the revelations presented in this book of
Mr.&nbsp;Jefferson’s real temper and opinions, unrestrained or
unmodified by the caution called for in public documents, make the work
not only valuable but entertaining.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. World.</i></p>

<p>The author has done her work with a loving hand, and has made a most
interesting book.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>It gives a picture of his private life, which it presents in a most
favorable light, calculated to redeem Jefferson’s character from many,
if not all, the aspersions and slanders which, in common with most
public characters, he had to endure while living.&mdash;<i>New Bedford
Standard.</i></p>

<p>The letters of Jefferson are models of epistolary
composition&mdash;easy, graceful, and simple.&mdash;<i>New Bedford
Mercury.</i></p>

<p>The book is a very good picture of the social life not only of
himself but of the age in which he lived.&mdash;<i>Detroit Post.</i></p>

<p>One of the most charming memoirs of the day.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y.
Times.</i></p>

<div class = "smalltype">

<p>Nothing need be said of the merits of this acknowledged on all hands
to be one of the very best boy’s books ever written. “Tom Brown” does
not reach the point of ideal excellence. He is not a faultless boy; but
his boy-faults, by the way they are corrected, help him in getting on.
The more of such reading can be furnished the better. There will never
be too much of it.&mdash;<i>Examiner and Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>Can be read a dozen times, and each time with tears and laughter as
genuine and impulsive as at the first.&mdash;<i>Rochester
Democrat.</i></p>

<p>Finely printed, and contains excellent illustrations. “Tom Brown” is
a book which will always be popular with boys, and it deserves to
be.&mdash;<i>World</i> (N.&nbsp;Y.).</p>

<p>For healthy reading it is one book in a
thousand.&mdash;<i>Advance.</i></p>

By the Author of “Tom Brown’s School Days.” New Edition. With

<div class = "smalltype">

<p>A new and very pretty edition. The illustrations are exceedingly
good, the typography is clear, and the paper white and fine. There is no
need to say any thing of the literary merits of the work, which has
become a kind of classic, and which presents the grand old Tory
University to the reader in all its glory and
fascination.&mdash;<i>Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>A book of which one never wearies.&mdash;<i>Presbyterian.</i></p>

<p>Fairly entitled to the rank and dignity of an English classic. Plot,
style, and truthfulness are of the soundest British character. Racy,
idiomatic, mirror-like, always interesting, suggesting thought on the
knottiest social and religious questions, now deeply moving by its
unconscious pathos, and anon inspiring uproarious laughter, it is a work
the world will not willingly let die.&mdash;<i>Christian

<hr class = "micro">

<div class = "smalltype">

<p>The book not only deserves to be read; it <i>will</i> be read,
because it is full of interest, concerning itself, as it does, with such
matters as girls’ boots and shoes; how girls should walk; low neck and
short sleeves; outrages upon the body; stockings supporters; why are
women so small? idleness among girls; sunshine and health; a word about
baths; what you should eat; how to manage a cold; fat and thin girls,
etc., etc.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Dio Lewis has written a sensible and lively book. There is not a
dull page in it, and scarcely one that does not convey some sound
instruction. We wish the book could enter thousands of our homes,
fashionable and unfashionable; for we believe it contains suggestions
and teaching of precisely the kind that “our girls” every where
need.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Independent.</i></p>

<p>This really important book.&mdash;<i>Christian Union.</i></p>

<p>Written in Dr. Lewis’s free and lively style, and is full of good
ideas, the fruit of long study and experience, told in a sensible,
practical way that commends them to every one who reads. The whole book
is admirably sensible.&mdash;<i>Boston Post.</i></p>

<p>Full of practical and very sensible advice to young
women.&mdash;<i>Episcopalian.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Lewis is well known as an acute observer, a man of great
practical sagacity in sanitary reform, and a lively and brilliant writer
upon medical subjects.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Observer.</i></p>

<p>We like it exceedingly. It says just what ought to be said, and that
in style colloquial, short, sharp, and memorable.&mdash;<i>Christian
Advocate.</i></p>

<p>The whole tone of the book is pure and healthy.&mdash;<i>Albany
Express.</i></p>

<p>Every page shows him to be in earnest, and thoroughly alive to the
importance of the subjects he discusses. He talks like one who has a
solemn message to deliver, and who deems the matter far more essential
than the manner. His book is, therefore, a series of short, earnest
appeals against the unnatural, foolish, and suicidal customs prevailing
in fashionable society.&mdash;<i>Churchman.</i></p>

<p>A timely and most desirable book.&mdash;<i>Springfield Union.</i></p>

<p>Full of spicy, sharp things about matters pertaining to health; full
of good advice, which, if people would but take it, would soon change
the world in some very important respects; not profound or systematic,
but still a book with numberless good things in it.&mdash;<i>Liberal
Christian.</i></p>

<p>The author writes with vigor and point, and with occasional dry
humor.&mdash;<i>Worcester Spy.</i></p>

<p>Brimful of good, common-sense hints regarding dress, diet,
recreation, and other necessary things in the female
economy.&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Lewis talks very plainly and sensibly, and makes very many
important suggestions. He does not mince matters at all, but puts every
thing in a straightforward and, not seldom, homely way, perspicuous to
the dullest understanding. His style is lively and readable, and the
book is very entertaining as well as instructive.&mdash;<i>Register</i>,

<p>A series of sensible, well-written, and pleasant essays on the care

<b>SCIENCE FOR THE YOUNG.</b></a></h3>

<h4 class = "extended">BY JACOB ABBOTT,</h4>

<p class = "center">
Author of “The Young Christian Series,” “Marco Paul Series,” “Rainbow
and Lucky Series,” “Little Learner Series,” “Franconia Stories,”
Illustrated Histories, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>Few men enjoy a wider or better earned popularity as a writer for the
young than Jacob Abbott. His series of histories, and stories
illustrative of moral truths, have furnished amusement and instruction
to thousands. He has the knack of piquing and gratifying curiosity. In
the book before us he shows his happy faculty of imparting useful
information through the medium of a pleasant narrative, keeping alive
the interest of the young reader, and fixing in his memory valuable
truths.&mdash;<i>Mercury</i>, New Bedford, Mass.</p>

<p>Jacob Abbott is almost the only writer in the English language who
knows how to combine real amusement with real instruction in such a
manner that the eager young readers are quite as much interested in the
useful knowledge he imparts as in the story which he makes so pleasant a
medium of instruction.&mdash;<i>Buffalo Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

Illuminated Cloth, black and gilt, $1&nbsp;50.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<div class = "smalltype">
<p>Perhaps that eminent and ancient gentleman who told his young master
that there was no royal road to science could admit that he was mistaken
after examining one of the volumes of the series “Science for the
Young,” which the Harpers are now bringing out. The first of these,
“Heat,” by Jacob Abbott, while bringing two or three young travelers
from a New York hotel across the ocean to Liverpool in a Cunarder, makes
them acquainted with most of the leading scientific principles regarding
heat. The idea of conveying scientific instruction in this manner is
admirable, and the method in which the plan is carried out is excellent.
While the youthful reader is skillfully entrapped into perusing what
appears to be an interesting story, and which is really so, he devours
the substance and principal facts of many learned treatises. Surely this
is a royal road for our young sovereigns to travel
over.&mdash;<i>World</i>, N.&nbsp;Y.</p>

<p>It combines information with amusement, weaving in with a story or
sketch of travel dry rules of mechanics or chemistry or philosophy.
Mr.&nbsp;Abbott accomplishes this object very successfully. The story is
a simple one, and the characters he introduces are natural and
agreeable. Readers of the volume, young and old, will follow it with
unabating interest, and it can not fail to have the intended
effect.&mdash;<i>Jewish Messenger.</i></p>

<p>It is admirably done. * * * Having tried the book with children, and
found it absolutely fascinating, even to a bright boy of eight, who has
had no special preparation for it, we can speak with entire confidence
of its value. The author has been careful in his statements of facts and
of natural laws to follow the very best authorities; and on some points
of importance his account is more accurate and more useful than that
given in many works of considerable scientific pretensions written
before the true character of heat as what Tyndall calls “a mode of
motion” was fully recognized. * * * Mr.&nbsp;Abbott has, in his “Heat,”
thrown a peculiar charm upon his pages, which makes them at once clear
and delightful to children who can enjoy a fairy
tale.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>* * * Mr. Abbott has avoided the errors so common with writers for
popular effect, that of slurring over the difficulties of the subject
through the desire of making it intelligible and attractive to unlearned
readers. He never tampers with the truth of science, nor attempts to
dodge the solution of a knotty problem behind a cloud of plausible
illustrations. The numerous illustrations which accompany every chapter
are of unquestionable value in the comprehension of the text, and come
next to actual experiment as an aid to the reader.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y.
Tribune.</i></p>

<p>Being Part II. of <i>Science for the Young</i>. By <span class =

Illuminated Cloth, black and gilt, $1&nbsp;50.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<div class = "smalltype">
<p>Treats of the theory of “Light,” presenting in a popular form the
latest conclusions of chemical and optical science on the subject, and
elucidating its various points of interest with characteristic clearness
and force. Its simplicity of language, and the beauty and
appropriateness of its pictorial illustrations, make it a most
attractive volume for young persons, while the fullness and accuracy of
the information with which it overflows commends it to the attention of
mature readers.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>Like the previous volume, it is in all respects admirable. It is a
mystery to us how Mr.&nbsp;Abbott can so simplify the most abstruse and
difficult principles, in which optics especially abounds, as to bring
them within the grasp of quite youthful readers; we can only be very
grateful to him for the result. This book is up to our latest knowledge
of the wonderful force of which it treats, and yet weaves all its
astounding facts into pleasing and readable narrative form. There are
few grown people, indeed, whose knowledge will not be vastly increased
by a perusal of this capital book.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Evening
Mail.</i></p>

<p>Perhaps there is no American author to whom our young people are
under so great a debt of gratitude as to this writer. The book before
us, like all its predecessors from the same pen, is lucid, simple,
amusing, and instructive. It is well gotten up and finely illustrated,
and should have a place in the library of every family where there are
children.&mdash;<i>N.&nbsp;Y. Star.</i></p>

<p>It is the second volume of a delightful series started by
Mr.&nbsp;Abbott under the title or “Science for the Young,” in which is
detailed interesting conversations and experiments, narratives of
travel, and adventures by the young in pursuit of knowledge. The science
of optics is here so plainly and so untechnically unfolded that many of
its most mysterious phenomena are rendered intelligible at
once.&mdash;<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer.</i></p>

<p>It is complete, and intensely interesting. Such a series must be of
great usefulness. It should be in every family library. The volume
before us is thorough, and succeeds in popularizing the branch of
science and natural history treated, and, we may add, there is nothing
more varied in its phenomena or important in its effects than
light.&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Journal.</i></p>

<p>Any person, young or old, who wishes to inform himself in a pleasant
way about the spectroscope, magic-lantern cameras, and other optical
instruments, and about solar, electric, calcium, magnesium, and all
other kinds of light, will find this book of Mr.&nbsp;Abbott both
interesting and instructive.&mdash;<i>Lutheran Observer.</i></p>

<h5><i>From the North British Review.</i></h5>

<h6>MISS MULOCK’S NOVELS.</h6>

<div class = "smalltype">

<p>She attempts to show how the trials, perplexities, joys, sorrows,
labors, and successes of life deepen or wither the character according
to its inward bent.</p>

<p>She cares to teach, <i>not</i> how dishonesty is always plunging men
into infinitely more complicated external difficulties than it would in
real life, but how any continued insincerity gradually darkens and
corrupts the very life-springs of the mind: <i>not</i> how all events
conspire to crush an unreal being who is to be the “example” of the
story, but how every event, adverse or fortunate, tends to strengthen
and expand a high mind, and to break the springs of a selfish or merely
weak and self-indulgent nature.</p>

<p>She does not limit herself to domestic conversations, and the mere
shock of character on character; she includes a large range of
events&mdash;the influence of worldly successes and failures&mdash;the
risks of commercial enterprises&mdash;the power of social
position&mdash;in short, the various elements of a wider economy than
that generally admitted into a tale.</p>

<p>She has a true respect for her work, and never permits herself to
“make books,” and yet she has evidently very great facility in making
them.</p>

<p>There are few writers who have exhibited a more marked progress,
whether in freedom of touch or in depth of purpose, than the authoress
of “The Ogilvies” and “John Halifax.”</p>

<p>Tennyson is, without exception, the most popular of living poets.
Wherever the English language is spoken, in America as well as in
England, his name has become familiar as a household word, and some
volume of the many he has published is to be found in almost every
library. For several years a complete cheap edition of his poetical
works has been an acknowledged desideratum. Messrs. Harper &amp;
Brothers, taking advantage of the conclusion of the Arthurian Poems,
have now supplied this want by publishing an attractive household
edition of the Laureate’s poems, in one volume, clearly and handsomely
printed, and illustrated with many engravings after designs by Gustave
Doré, Rossetti, Stanfield, W.&nbsp;H. Hunt, and other eminent artists.
The volume contains every line the Laureate has ever published,
including the latest of his productions, which complete the noble cycle
of Arthurian legends, and raise them from a fragmentary series of
exquisite cabinet pictures into a magnificent tragic epic, of which the
theme is the gradual dethronement of Arthur from his spiritual rule over
his order, through the crime of Guinevere and Lancelot; the spread of
their infectious guilt, till it breaks up the oneness of the realm, and
the Order of the Round Table is shattered, and the ideal king, deserted
by many of his own knights, and deeply wounded in the last great battle
with the traitor and the heathen, vanishes into the darkness of the
world beyond.</p>

<p>The print is clear and excellent; the paper is good; the volume has
illustrations from Doré, Millais, and other great artists. Really, the
edition is a sort of prodigy in its way.&mdash;<i>Independent.</i></p>

<p>Those who want a perfect and complete edition of the works of the
great English Poet Laureate should purchase the Harper
edition.&mdash;<i>Troy Budget.</i></p>

<p>A marvel of cheapness.&mdash;<i>The Christian Era.</i></p>

<p>The whole get-up and style of this edition are admirable, and we are
sure it will be a welcome addition to every book-case, large or small.
But the marvelous thing about it is the price, which is only <i>one
dollar</i> for the handsome cloth binding.&mdash;<i>Tribune</i>
(Wilmington, Del.).</p>

<p>A marvelous instance of blended beauty and
cheapness.&mdash;<i>Charleston Courier.</i></p>
